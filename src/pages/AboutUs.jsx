                  Engineering is the practice of turning ideas into real-world
                  solutions by combining creativity, math, and problem-solving.
                  Engineers design systems that must work reliably under real
                  constraints, whether that means building bridges that can
                  withstand earthquakes, writing software that handles millions
                  of users, or creating machines that use less energy while
                  doing more work. What makes engineering unique is the constant
                  balance between theory and practicality—an elegant design is
                  only successful if it can be built, maintained, and improved
